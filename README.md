# Orbital Evolution of Extreme Mass Ratio Binaries

A simple program that calculates and plots the orbital evolution of extreme mass ratio binaries in stationary and axisymmetric spacetimes, according to Einstein's general theory of relativty.

## Theoretical Knowledge

The relevant physics and assumptions that went into the calculation of the orbits are included [here](https://github.com/kul-arun/orbital-evolution-of-extreme-mass-ratio-binaries-in-stationary-and-axisymmetric-spacetimes/theory.pdf).
